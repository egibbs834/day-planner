# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

Attached is my submission for Homework 5. The objectives to be completed were:

WHEN I open the planner, THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down, THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day, THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock, THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock, THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page, THEN the saved events persist
```
I ran into a number of issues and was not able to complete several of the objectives.
